# Example 1: A Network Printer (e.g., Epson T88 connected via Ethernet)

# Example 2: A Serial/USB Printer (CURRENTLY NOT SUPPORTED - set to "mock")
# If you have a COM port printer, we are currently simulating it.

# --- CASH DRAWERS ---
# Define cash drawers here.
[[devices.drawers]]

# --- CUSTOMER DISPLAYS ---
# Define pole displays/customer screens here.
